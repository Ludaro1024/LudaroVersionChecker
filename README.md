# Ludaro-Versionchecker

this is a simple scripts made for myScripts to implement a Versionchecker in their scripts, in FiveM this is free to use for everyone!

you just need to change the repo in the versionchecker.lua or in the fxmanifest of the script you are using you can insert it like this
```lua
github("yourrepolink")
```
it will automaticly detect the version the script is using right now by the fxmanifest and will show if newer scripts exist. :) nothing too fancy!
